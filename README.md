# ATM-Performance-Analysis-Dashboard-
Objective of the Project:
Our primary goal was to provide a comprehensive and intuitive view of ATM performance across various metrics, enabling data-driven decision-making to optimize operations, identify revenue opportunities, and control costs.

What's Inside the Project:
This project involved developing an interactive dashboard that consolidates key ATM operational and financial data. It allows for detailed analysis of transactions, revenue, costs, and profitability at both an overall and individual ATM level.

Technologies Used:
Leveraging the power of Microsoft Excel, we designed and implemented a robust and dynamic dashboard. The project heavily utilized Excel's advanced formulas, pivot tables, and charting capabilities to transform raw data into actionable insights.

What We Extract in the Dashboard:
From the detailed data, the dashboard extracts and visualizes crucial insights such as:

Monthly & Annual Transaction Trends: Fin, Non-Fin, and Total Transactions.

Revenue & Cost Analysis: Monthly Revenue, MHA Revenue, ATM Revenue Total, various operational costs (e.g., CRA, FLM, Supplies, Rent, EBILL).

Profitability Metrics: Gross Profit and Gross Profit Percentage.

ATM Performance by State & ID: Allowing drill-down into specific ATM performance.

Quarterly Performance & Margin Analysis: Understanding seasonal trends and profitability ranges.

Uptime Tracking: A critical indicator of ATM availability and service quality.

This dashboard is a powerful tool for monitoring and improving ATM network efficiency and profitability! #DataAnalytics #Excel #Dashboard #BusinessIntelligence #ATMLogistics #BankOfBaroda #PerformanceAnalysis #DataDriven
